QUES1 Define blockchain in your own words (100–150 words).
ANS1 A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger composed of linked blocks that store data securely and transparently.
     Each block contains information such as transactions, a timestamp, a unique hash, and the hash of the previous block, 
     forming a tamper-resistant chain. Instead of relying on a central authority, blockchain uses cryptographic algorithms 
     and consensus mechanisms to ensure all participants agree on the state of the ledger. This makes blockchains secure, 
     immutable, and transparent — ideal for environments where trust between parties is limited. Because data is stored across 
     many nodes, altering a single record would require changing every copy of the ledger, which is computationally infeasible.


QUES2 List 2 real-life use cases (e.g., supply chain, digital identity).
ANS2 Here are 2 real-life use cases of blockchain technology:
     1. Supply Chain Management: Companies like Walmart and Maersk use blockchain to trace items form origin to destination at every step.
     2. Digital Identity: Estonia uses blockchain to create a secure digital identity for its citizens.


QUES3 Draw a block showing: data, previous hash, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root.
ANS3 
        ____________________________
        │     Block #1             │
        |--------------------------|
        │ Data: Transaction info   │
        │ Timestamp: 1629876543    │
        │ Nonce: 38782             │
        │ Previous Hash: abc123... │
        │ Merkle Root: d43e91...   │
        |__________________________|

QUES4 Briefly explain with an example how the Merkle root helps verify data integrity.
ANS4 A Merkle root is a single hash representing all the transactions in a block, derived by repeatedly hashing 
     pairs of transactions into a binary tree structure. For example, if a block contains four transactions 
     (T1, T2, T3, T4), their hashes are combined as:
         H1 = hash(T1), H2 = hash(T2) → H12 = hash(H1 + H2)
         H3 = hash(T3), H4 = hash(T4) → H34 = hash(H3 + H4)
         Final Merkle Root = hash(H12 + H34)
         This allows fast verification of whether a transaction exists in the block without revealing all data, 
         ensuring data integrity.


QUES5 What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?
ANS5 Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle 
     (finding a hash with certain leading zeros) by changing a nonce value. The first miner to find a valid hash 
     broadcasts the block, and others verify it. This process requires significant computational power and energy, 
     which prevents spam or malicious alterations, as rewriting history would demand immense resources.


QUES6 What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?
ANS6 Proof of Stake selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" 
     as collateral. The more you stake, the higher your chances of being selected to validate the next block. 
     Unlike PoW, PoS doesn’t require solving puzzles, making it more energy-efficient and faster, with economic 
     incentives aligned toward honest behavior.


QUES7 What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?
ANS7 Delegated Proof of Stake builds on PoS by letting token holders vote for a small set of trusted delegates (validators) 
     who take turns producing blocks. These validators are incentivized to act honestly or risk being voted out. 
     DPoS enables faster transactions and greater scalability but can be more centralized due to fewer participants controlling validation.
